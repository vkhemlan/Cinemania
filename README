Cinemania is a demonstration project to practise Django and 
JQuery and with no practical purpose

It simulates a working cinema, where its managers want to be 
able to schedule movies for specific dates and in certain 
rooms.

Customers have the ability to see the schedule and to 
purchase tickets and even to choose their own seat.
